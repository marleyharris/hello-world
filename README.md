# hello-world
to be honest, im not quite sure what im supposed to be doing 
I am a senior at NUAMES. I enjoy going to concerts, playing the drums, rock climbing and hiking. In college, I want to study wither marine biology or finance. However, in all honesty, I change my mind every week, so who knows.
